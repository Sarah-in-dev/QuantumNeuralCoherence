QUANTUM NEURAL COHERENCE ANALYSIS - KEY FINDINGS
==============================================

1. SIGNIFICANT FREQUENCY BAND DIFFERENCES:
   * delta Band: High Ambiguity (19.299 ± 2.389) vs. Low Ambiguity (20.104 ± 2.542)
     Difference: -0.806 ± 1.430, t(19) = -2.456, p = 0.0239, Cohen's d = -0.318

2. SIGNIFICANT QUANTUM METRICS:
   * No significant quantum metrics found.

3. STRONG CORRELATIONS (|r| > 0.5):
   * beta and gamma: r = 0.754
   * TE (C→F) and TE Asymmetry: r = -0.748
   * TE (C→F) and gamma: r = -0.715
   * TE Asymmetry and gamma: r = 0.702
   * alpha and theta: r = 0.687
   * delta and theta: r = 0.591
   * gamma and theta: r = 0.589
   * alpha and gamma: r = 0.560
   * TE Asymmetry and beta: r = 0.560
   * Phase Sync (Beta) and TE Asymmetry: r = -0.539
   * TE (C→F) and beta: r = -0.516
   * Phase Sync (Beta) and gamma: r = -0.515
   * Phase Sync (Alpha) and TE Asymmetry: r = -0.511
   * beta and theta: r = 0.502

4. INTERPRETATION AND QUANTUM SIGNATURES:

5. QUANTUM VS. CLASSICAL INTERPRETATION:
   The analysis does not reveal significant quantum metrics,
   suggesting that the neural processing during this perceptual
   task is adequately explained by classical mechanisms.
